TITLE: The elements of statistical learning: The best review!
CONTENTS:
The Elements of Statistical Learning: The Bible of Machine Learning Learn all the Theory underlying Machine Learning and Data Mining with the most contrasted book on the topic: The Elements of Statistical Learning! The Elements of Statistical Learning: The following is a review of the book The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics) by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshriani and Jerome Friedman. Review As mentioned in the title, The Elements of St atistical Learning is seen by many Gurus as the Bible of Machine Learning. This second edition was published in 2009, and despite being an old text, it remains as the king of books to become a serious expert in the theory underlying Machine Learning. It is a very conceptual and theoretical book, where many examples are given, and it comes with very illustrative and high-quality figures. It covers topics that go from Supervised and Unsupervised learning to Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines , Decision Trees and much much more. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, Random forests, Ensemble methods, least angle regression & LASSO (one of the authors, Tibshirani, is actually the creator of this regularisation technique), non-negative matrix factorisation, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for “wide” data (number of features being larger than the number of data points), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. We want to make it very clear that The Elements of Statistical Learning is a highly theoretical book, it does not speak about programming, and the maths required to understand it is that of a medium-high level. It is therefore not a book we would recommend to beginners on statistics, or for those that are looking to learn to implement Machine Learning algorithms in R or Python . Rather, we think this book is best for those that have a good statistics and mathematics foundation, that have been implementing and working with Machine Learning for a while, and that want to scale their knowledge or the theoretical concepts and the magic underlying the different algorithms. If you are looking for a text to get into Machine Learning and the needed statistics with a better balance between theory and practice, we advice going for ‘ Introduction to Statistical Learning with R ‘, by the same authors. You can find it here . Another good book with great content in Python this time, is ‘Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit – Learn , Keras and Tensorflow ‘. You can find a wonderful review of that book here . Despite being very theoretical, The Elements of Statistical Learning avoids spinning around on the same topic or tedious and long demonstrations, going straight to the point in each subject, which makes it a great reference manual to refresh the deepest corners of Machine Learning algorithms. Because of this it is a great document to have for both researchers and those that use Machine Learning techniques in the business world. Overall, we think it is a must have manual in the shelf of anybody who aims to be a Machine Learning expert, and definitely a good resource to reach cutting edge knowledge in this field. Content of the Elements of Statistical Learning The contents of the book are the following: Introduction Overview of Supervised Learning Linear Methods for Regression Linear Methods for Classification Basis

Title: The Elements of Statistical Learning Series: Springer Series in Statistics Author: Trevor Hastier, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman Genre: Machine Learning Algorithms Publisher: Springer Science Release Date: 2001 Pages: 533 About the Book: This book is a collection of topics which are loosely organized but the discussion of the topics is extremely clear.   The loose organization of topics has the advantage that one can flip around the book and read different sections without having to read earlier sections. A beginner to machine learning might start by reading Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 13, and 14 very carefully and then read the initial sections of the remaining chapters to get an idea about what types of topics they cover. The choice of topics hit most of the major areas of machine learning and the pedagogical style and writing style is quite clear. There are lots of great exercises, great color illustrations, intuitive explanations, relevant but not excessive mathematical notation, and numerous comments which are extremely relevant for applying theses ideas in practice. Both this book and the text by Bishop ( Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning ) are handy references which I like to keep by my side at all times! Indeed,  both of these texts are perhaps the two most popular graduate level textbooks on Machine Learning. I would say that if your training is in the field of statistics or mathematics you will probably like The Elements of Statistical Learning a little better than Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning but if your training is in the field of engineering you may like Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning a little better than the Elements of Statistical Learning . Do not confuse this book with “An introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R” by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani. The book “An Introduction to Statistical Learning” is a great book and covers similar topics but it is less mathematical and is more focused on applications and software implementations than “The Elements of Statistical Learning”. Chapter 2 provides an overview of Supervised learning. Chapters 3 and 4 discuss linear methods for regression and classification. Then, Chapter 5 introduces the key concepts of basis functions and regularization.  A “basis function” can be described as a type of feature detector. With the right types of feature detectors or “basis functions”, it may be possible to approximate a complicated nonlinear function as a weighted sum of basis functions. This type of approach is used in eigenvector analysis and fourier analysis and plays a key role in Deep Learning methods.  Regularization is also a crucial concept which is discussed here. A nice feature of Chapter 5 is that it includes brief but useful discussions o

With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting—the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit.

It is a rigorous and mathematically dense book on machine learning techniques. Be sure to refine your understanding of linear algebra and convex optimization before reading this book. Nonetheless, the investment will totally worth it. 11 likes Like Comment Clif Davis 1 review Follow Follow February 16, 2013 Excellent book. Has repaid multiple rereadings and is a wonderful springboard for developing your own ideas in the area. Currently I'm going through Additive Models again which I breezed by the first few times.
